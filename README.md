# WeatherWizard
The following website shows a weather dashboard with form inputs.
When I search for a city I am presented with:
the name, current and future conditions, the temperature, the humidity, the wind speed, and the UV index  for that city
When I view the UV index, I am presented with a color that indicates whether the conditions are favorable, moderate, or severe
Future weather conditions for that city shows a 5-day forecast that displays the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, the wind speed, and the humidity
When I click on a city in the search history, I am again presented with current and future conditions for that city
